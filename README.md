A set of neural network model with the purpose of compare different activation functions and it effect to the learning process.
This is inspired in the following article:

[Exploring Activation Functions for Neural Networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-activation-functions-for-neural-networks-73498da59b02)

In this article you can fing detailed information on:
- neural network architecture
- explanation of effect different activation functions
