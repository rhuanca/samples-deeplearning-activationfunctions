# Testing Action Functions

A set of neural network model with the purpose of compare different activation functions and it effect to the learning process.
This is inspired in the following article:

[Exploring Activation Functions for Neural Networks](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-activation-functions-for-neural-networks-73498da59b02)

In this article you can fing detailed information on:
- neural network architecture
- explanation of effect different activation functions

## Dataset

This test is using the hello world dataset of neural networks:

[THE MNIST DATABASE](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

The mnist dataset is in IDX format, a description of how this dataset is here:

Also here is a repo were we can find a way to parse it:
